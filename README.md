# Object-Oriented-Application-Development
## Description: 
- Understanding of programming fundamentals, including control and data structures and the use of built-in classes.
- Understanding is reinforced throughout the course through the development of standalone applications.
- Study of object-oriented programming concepts and practices, from defining classes and methods to the more advanced object- oriented concepts.

#### Assignment 1a (if..else)
Write a program that computes the start and end time of a break that occurs midway through a class as well as the end time for that class. The program must prompt the user to enter the starting hour and starting minute of the class, in that exact order, based on a 24-hour clock.

#### Assignment 1b (named constants)
The program must first prompt the user to enter the number of pounds and the number of ounces for the shipment (integer values). Next, the user must be prompted for the type of delivery, with 1 for express or any other number for regular. Lastly, the user is prompted to enter a 1 if they have a coupon or any other number if they do not.

#### Assignment 2 (Loops)
For this assignment, you will be writing a program that calculates college costs for a two- or four-year public (in-state or out-of-state) college. After getting input from the user and calculating the cost of one year of college based on those inputs, verify that all of the paths through your code are functioning properly. Then add functionality to your existing code for verifying valid input data. 

#### Assignment 3 (Arrays)
In this assignment, you will be writing a game that makes use of arrays. A class called RandomLetters has been posted along with this assignment. You will be using a method in this class for generating an array containing four letters (as char data) chosen from the letters ranging from ‘a’ to ‘f’. 

#### Assignment 4 (String class and instance methods)
This assignment focuses on classes, instance methods, and static methods.

#### Assignment 5 (Static and Instance )
In this assignment, you will be adding code to predefined classes for maintaining information on passengers seated on a plane.
